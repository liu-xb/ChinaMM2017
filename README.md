We present some new layers such as "ReduceLayer", "SimED2LossLayer" and "ConvReLULayer".

We also present a tool to extract features: "my_extract_features", which writes features in binary files. A set of scripts is presented to read the features and to test the performance. An example of how to use the tools and scripts is shown in folder "CIFAR-10".

Please feel free to contact me if you have any question. 

More details of this project will be released very soon.
